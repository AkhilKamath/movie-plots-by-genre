# movie-plots-by-genre
Movie plots by genre tutorial at PyData Berlin 20 May 2016. 

See slides for the narrative.

The requirements are:

- Python 3
- Google News pre-trained word2vec model (1.5 Gb) from [here]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)
- pip3 install cython gensim sklearn pandas matplotlib nltk pyemd jupyter

On OSX you might want to download pyemd from github and install it via `python3 setup.py install`.

__If you are short on bandwidth__ then you will be able to follow most of the tutorial just with these libraries:

- Python 3
- pip3 install cython gensim sklearn pandas matplotlib nltk pyemd jupyter
